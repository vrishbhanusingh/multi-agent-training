# Description: Integrate all components of the multi-agent system into a cohesive solution and develop comprehensive test suites to validate the complete system architecture across various scenarios.
# Details:
This task requires integrating the A2A Protocol, Orchestration Layer, and Query Understanding components into a unified system. The integration process should include:

2. Establish communication channels between the Orchestration Layer and agent endpoints using the A2A Protocol over RabbitMQ.
3. Implement end-to-end workflows that demonstrate complete system functionality from user query to final response.
4. Develop a comprehensive logging and monitoring system across all components to track message flow and system state.
5. Create configuration management for the integrated system, allowing for environment-specific deployments.
6. Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms at integration points.
7. Optimize message passing and reduce latency between system components.
8. Document the integrated architecture, including component interactions, data flow diagrams, and sequence diagrams.
9. Establish CI/CD pipelines for the integrated system to ensure consistent deployment.
10. Create a system health dashboard to monitor the operational status of all components.

# Test Strategy:
The testing strategy should validate the integrated system through multiple approaches:

1. End-to-End Test Suite:
   - Create test cases covering the full spectrum of user queries from simple to complex
   - Validate correct query understanding, task decomposition, and agent coordination
   - Verify proper response generation and delivery back to the user

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test all integration points between components with mock services
   - Verify correct message transformation and routing between components
   - Validate error propagation and handling across component boundaries

3. Performance Testing:
   - Conduct load testing with simulated concurrent users (start with 50, scale to 500)
   - Measure and establish baseline response times for various query complexities
   - Identify bottlenecks in the integrated system under load
   - Test system recovery after component failures

4. Resilience Testing:
   - Simulate component failures and verify graceful degradation
   - Test recovery mechanisms after service disruptions
   - Validate message persistence and recovery after broker restarts

5. Acceptance Testing:
   - Create user journey tests that validate end-to-end functionality
   - Verify system behavior matches specifications and requirements
   - Document test results with metrics on reliability, performance, and correctness

All tests should be automated where possible and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline with detailed reporting of test coverage and results.
