# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Orchestrator Agent with DAG-based Workflow Planning
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and develop the orchestrator agent that receives user queries, plans workflows as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and makes these DAGs available to executor agents through a well-defined interface.
# Details:
The orchestrator agent should be implemented as a standalone service with the following components and capabilities:

1. **Query Reception Interface**:
   - Create a REST API endpoint or message queue consumer to receive user queries/requests
   - Implement request validation and sanitization
   - Support synchronous and asynchronous query submission patterns
   - Include authentication and authorization mechanisms

2. **DAG Planning Engine**:
   - Develop a workflow planner that decomposes user queries into discrete tasks
   - Implement logic to determine dependencies between tasks
   - Generate a formal DAG representation with nodes (tasks) and edges (dependencies)
   - Include metadata for each task (estimated complexity, required capabilities, etc.)
   - Handle edge cases like circular dependencies or invalid requests

3. **DAG Storage and Distribution**:
   - Implement a Postgres schema for storing DAGs, tasks, and their relationships
   - Alternatively/additionally, set up a RabbitMQ topic for publishing DAG updates
   - Create a versioning mechanism for DAGs to track changes
   - Implement transaction handling to ensure DAG consistency

4. **Task Dispatch Interface**:
   - Create an API or message interface for executor agents to retrieve tasks
   - Implement mechanisms for executors to report task completion/failure
   - Include task prioritization logic
   - Support task reassignment in case of execution failures

5. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Implement comprehensive logging of DAG creation and modifications
   - Create metrics for orchestration performance (planning time, execution time)
   - Add tracing capabilities to track workflow execution across the system

The implementation should follow clean architecture principles with clear separation between:
- Domain logic (DAG planning)
- Infrastructure concerns (storage, messaging)
- Interface adapters (APIs, message handlers)

Use dependency injection to ensure components are testable and loosely coupled. Document all interfaces thoroughly to ensure executor agents can be developed independently.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover all aspects of the orchestrator agent:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test DAG generation logic with various query types
   - Verify correct dependency resolution
   - Test edge cases (empty queries, complex dependencies, etc.)
   - Validate error handling and input validation

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test Postgres schema with actual DAG storage and retrieval
   - Verify RabbitMQ publishing and consumption if implemented
   - Test API endpoints with mock clients
   - Validate transaction handling and data consistency

3. **System Tests**:
   - Create end-to-end tests with mock executor agents
   - Simulate complete workflows from query submission to task completion
   - Test recovery from simulated failures
   - Verify correct handling of concurrent requests

4. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure DAG generation time for queries of varying complexity
   - Test system under load with multiple concurrent requests
   - Verify database performance with large DAGs
   - Measure message throughput if using message queues

5. **Specific Test Cases**:
   - Simple linear workflow (A → B → C)
   - Complex DAG with multiple branches and joins
   - DAG with high fan-out (one task spawning many parallel tasks)
   - DAG with high fan-in (many tasks converging to a single task)
   - Invalid query that should be rejected
   - Query that generates a DAG with isolated tasks (no dependencies)

Implement CI pipeline to run tests automatically. Create a test harness that allows manual testing of the orchestrator through its API interfaces.

## Dark Mode Implementation

### Core Implementation
```typescript
// DarkModeToggle.tsx
const DarkModeToggle = () => {
  const [darkMode, setDarkMode] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Check localStorage on mount
    const isDark = localStorage.getItem('darkMode') === 'true';
    setDarkMode(isDark);
    if (isDark) document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
  }, []);
  
  const toggleDarkMode = () => {
    const newDarkMode = !darkMode;
    setDarkMode(newDarkMode);
    localStorage.setItem('darkMode', newDarkMode.toString());
    
    if (newDarkMode) {
      document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
    } else {
      document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark');
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <button 
      onClick={toggleDarkMode}
      className="p-2 rounded-full hover:bg-gray-200 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 transition-colors"
      aria-label={darkMode ? "Switch to light mode" : "Switch to dark mode"}
    >
      {darkMode ? (
        <SunIcon className="h-5 w-5 text-yellow-400" />
      ) : (
        <MoonIcon className="h-5 w-5 text-gray-600" />
      )}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### Tailwind Configuration
```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        'dark-bg': '#0f172a',
        'dark-surface': '#1e293b',
        'dark-elevated': '#334155',
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
}
```

### Component Styling Examples
```tsx
// Dashboard component dark mode styling
<div className="flex flex-col h-screen bg-gray-50 dark:bg-dark-bg text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100 transition-colors duration-200">
  <header className="bg-white dark:bg-dark-surface shadow-sm border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
    {/* Header content */}
  </header>
  
  <main className="flex-1 p-6 overflow-auto">
    {/* Dashboard content */}
  </main>
</div>

// Chart component with dark mode support
const chartOptions = {
  responsive: true,
  maintainAspectRatio: false,
  plugins: {
    legend: {
      labels: {
        color: darkMode ? '#f1f5f9' : '#334155',
      },
    },
  },
  scales: {
    x: {
      grid: {
        color: darkMode ? 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)' : 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
      },
      ticks: {
        color: darkMode ? '#cbd5e1' : '#64748b',
      },
    },
    y: {
      grid: {
        color: darkMode ? 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)' : 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)',
      },
      ticks: {
        color: darkMode ? '#cbd5e1' : '#64748b',
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Accessibility Considerations
- All color combinations meet WCAG AA contrast requirements in both themes
- Focus states remain clearly visible in dark mode with custom focus rings
- Interactive elements maintain distinct hover/active states in dark mode
- Status indicators use appropriate luminance values for dark backgrounds
- SVG icons have appropriate color adjustments for dark mode visibility

### ReactFlow Dark Theme Integration
```typescript
// Custom ReactFlow dark theme
const reactFlowDarkTheme = {
  bg: '#1e293b',
  nodeBg: '#334155',
  nodeColor: '#f8fafc',
  nodeBorder: '#475569',
  nodeSelectedBorder: '#38bdf8',
  edgeStroke: '#94a3b8',
  connectionLineStroke: '#94a3b8',
};

// Apply theme conditionally
<ReactFlow
  nodes={nodes}
  edges={edges}
  nodeTypes={nodeTypes}
  className="bg-white dark:bg-dark-surface transition-colors duration-200"
  defaultViewport={{ x: 0, y: 0, zoom: 1 }}
  theme={darkMode ? reactFlowDarkTheme : undefined}
>
  {/* ReactFlow content */}
</ReactFlow>
```
