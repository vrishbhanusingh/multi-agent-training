# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Orchestration Layer with DAG Execution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive orchestration system using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) for task decomposition and execution coordination between agents, serving as the planning and coordination mechanism for complex multi-agent workflows.
# Details:
Create an orchestration layer that uses DAGs to model and execute complex workflows across multiple agents. The implementation should:

1. Define a DAG data structure with nodes representing individual agent tasks and edges representing dependencies and data flow between tasks.
2. Implement a DAG parser that can convert workflow definitions (in YAML or JSON format) into executable DAG structures.
3. Create a DAG execution engine that:
   - Determines the correct execution order based on dependencies
   - Handles parallel execution of independent tasks
   - Manages data passing between dependent tasks
   - Provides status tracking for in-progress workflows
   - Implements error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. Develop a workflow definition language/schema that allows for:
   - Specifying agent assignments for each task
   - Defining input/output parameters for tasks
   - Setting conditional execution paths
   - Configuring timeout and retry policies
5. Integrate with the A2A protocol implementation (Task #11) to:
   - Use standardized message formats for inter-agent communication
   - Leverage the existing RabbitMQ infrastructure for message passing
6. Implement workflow persistence to allow for recovery from system failures
7. Create monitoring interfaces to track workflow execution progress
8. Provide APIs for:
   - Workflow submission
   - Workflow status querying
   - Workflow cancellation/modification
   - Historical workflow analysis
9. Refactor the MCP server to support the orchestrator agent and executor agents in the DAG-based workflow system

The orchestration layer should be designed as a separate service that coordinates but doesn't directly implement agent functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the correctness and performance of the orchestration layer:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test DAG data structure operations (adding nodes/edges, cycle detection, topological sorting)
   - Test workflow parser with valid and invalid workflow definitions
   - Test execution engine components in isolation with mocked dependencies

2. Integration Tests:
   - Create test workflows with mock agents that verify:
     - Simple linear workflows execute in correct order
     - Parallel execution paths work correctly
     - Conditional branching functions as expected
     - Data is correctly passed between dependent tasks
   - Test integration with A2A protocol by verifying message format compliance
   - Verify workflow persistence and recovery mechanisms
   - Test refactored MCP server endpoints for orchestrator and executor agent interactions

3. Performance Tests:
   - Measure throughput with varying numbers of concurrent workflows
   - Test with large complex DAGs (100+ nodes) to verify scalability
   - Measure latency of workflow operations (submission, status queries, etc.)

4. Failure Recovery Tests:
   - Simulate agent failures during workflow execution
   - Test system recovery after orchestration service restart
   - Verify timeout handling and retry mechanisms

5. End-to-End Tests:
   - Create realistic multi-agent workflows that accomplish meaningful tasks
   - Verify entire system functions correctly with real (not mocked) agents
   - Test the complete flow from query submission to orchestrator to execution by executor agents

All tests should be automated and included in the CI/CD pipeline.
