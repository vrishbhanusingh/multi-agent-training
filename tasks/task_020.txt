# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement EvaluatorAgent for Task Outcome Assessment and Reward Assignment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and develop the EvaluatorAgent that subscribes to task results from RabbitMQ, validates task outputs, calculates rewards, and updates the database with structured feedback to enable the reinforcement learning loop.
# Details:
The EvaluatorAgent serves as the impartial judge in the Adaptive Orchestration Loop, translating raw executor results into structured feedback and quantitative reward signals. Key implementation components:

1. **RabbitMQ Integration**:
   - Subscribe to the 'task_results_queue' to receive executor results
   - Implement message acknowledgment and error handling
   - Add connection recovery and retry mechanisms

2. **Output Validation Framework**:
   - Create a pluggable validation system that dispatches based on executor_type
   - Implement validators for common task types: code_executor, file_writer, api_caller
   - Add support for custom validation rules based on task metadata
   - Include content validation (checking file existence, API response codes, etc.)

3. **Reward Calculation Engine**:
   - Implement a sophisticated reward function with multiple components:
     * Base rewards: +1.0 for successful tasks, -1.0 for failures
     * Retry bonuses: +1.5 for tasks that succeed after retries (demonstrates learning)
     * Complexity bonuses: Higher rewards for successfully completing complex tasks
     * Speed penalties: Reduced rewards for tasks that exceed expected duration
   - Add configurable reward parameters for fine-tuning

4. **Structured Feedback Generation**:
   - Create JSONB feedback structures that capture:
     * Validation results and confidence scores
     * Error analysis with categorization (syntax, logic, resource, network, etc.)
     * Performance metrics (execution time, resource usage)
     * Suggestions for improvement when applicable
   - Implement feedback summarization for human-readable reports

5. **Database Integration**:
   - Update task records with reward scores and feedback_notes
   - Implement transaction handling to ensure data consistency
   - Add batch processing for high-throughput scenarios
   - Include retry logic for database connection issues

6. **Learning Analytics**:
   - Track reward distribution patterns over time
   - Identify trends in task success rates by type and complexity
   - Generate insights for orchestrator improvement

The EvaluatorAgent should be designed as a stateless microservice that can be scaled horizontally as the system grows.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive testing should verify the evaluator's accuracy, reliability, and performance:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test reward calculation with various task outcomes and retry scenarios
   - Verify validation logic for different task types with known good/bad outputs
   - Test feedback generation with edge cases (malformed results, missing data)
   - Validate database update operations with mock connections

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Set up test RabbitMQ environment and verify message consumption
   - Test end-to-end flow from executor result to database update
   - Verify interaction with actual task result messages from executor agents
   - Test database transaction handling under concurrent load

3. **Validation Accuracy Tests**:
   - Create a test suite with known task results (both successful and failed)
   - Measure validation accuracy against human expert judgments
   - Test edge cases like partially successful tasks or ambiguous outputs
   - Verify that validation confidence scores correlate with actual accuracy

4. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure processing time for various result types and sizes
   - Test throughput with simulated high-volume task completion scenarios
   - Verify memory usage remains stable during extended operation
   - Test scaling behavior with multiple evaluator instances

5. **Reliability Tests**:
   - Simulate RabbitMQ connection failures and verify recovery
   - Test behavior during database outages with proper error handling
   - Verify that no messages are lost during system restarts
   - Test with malformed or corrupted task result messages

Success criteria: 95%+ validation accuracy, <100ms average processing time per result, zero message loss during normal operations.
