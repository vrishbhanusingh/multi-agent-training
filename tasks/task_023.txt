# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement PPO-based Reinforcement Learning Training Loop for Orchestrator Policy Updates
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning system that trains the OrchestratorAgent's decision-making policy using the experience data collected from workflow executions and correction attempts.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive RL training system that enables the OrchestratorAgent to improve its planning and correction capabilities over time:

1. **Experience Collection System**:
   - Implement experience buffer that aggregates data from completed workflows
   - Design state representation that captures:
     * User query context and intent
     * Current workflow state and task dependencies
     * Available system capabilities and resources
     * Historical performance data for similar queries
   - Create action encoding for both initial DAG generation and correction decisions
   - Implement reward aggregation from individual task outcomes to workflow-level rewards

2. **PPO Algorithm Implementation**:
   - Build core PPO training loop with actor-critic architecture
   - Implement policy network that takes workflow context as input and outputs DAG generation decisions
   - Create value network for state value estimation
   - Add advantage estimation using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)
   - Implement clipped surrogate objective with KL divergence penalty

3. **Neural Network Architecture**:
   - Design transformer-based model for handling variable-length workflow contexts
   - Implement attention mechanisms for focusing on relevant query components
   - Add separate heads for different decision types (task generation, dependency creation, correction planning)
   - Include embedding layers for task types, error categories, and system capabilities

4. **Training Infrastructure**:
   - Create training data pipeline that preprocesses experience buffer data
   - Implement distributed training capabilities for large-scale learning
   - Add model checkpointing and versioning for safe updates
   - Include hyperparameter optimization and training monitoring

5. **Model Deployment and Updates**:
   - Design safe model deployment pipeline with A/B testing capabilities
   - Implement model performance monitoring in production
   - Add rollback mechanisms for poorly performing model updates
   - Create gradual model update strategies to prevent disruption

6. **Safety and Constraints**:
   - Implement safety constraints to prevent generation of invalid DAGs
   - Add maximum correction attempt limits to prevent infinite loops
   - Include reward shaping to encourage efficient and safe behavior
   - Implement monitoring for model bias and fairness issues

The training system should be designed to run periodically (daily/weekly) on accumulated experience data, with the ability to update the orchestrator's policy incrementally while maintaining system stability.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the RL system's learning capability, safety, and production readiness:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test PPO algorithm components with synthetic data
   - Verify neural network architecture with known input/output pairs
   - Test experience buffer data processing and aggregation
   - Validate safety constraints prevent invalid DAG generation

2. **Learning Performance Tests**:
   - Create synthetic workflow scenarios with known optimal solutions
   - Measure learning convergence over training iterations
   - Test with various reward functions and hyperparameter settings
   - Verify that trained models outperform baseline random policies

3. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test complete training pipeline from experience collection to model deployment
   - Verify integration with orchestrator for model inference
   - Test A/B testing framework for safe model updates
   - Validate monitoring and rollback mechanisms

4. **Safety and Robustness Tests**:
   - Test model behavior with adversarial or unusual inputs
   - Verify safety constraints prevent harmful actions
   - Test model performance degradation detection
   - Validate that training doesn't destabilize existing functionality

5. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure training time for various dataset sizes
   - Test model inference latency in production scenarios
   - Verify memory usage during training and inference
   - Test scaling behavior with increasing data volumes

6. **Production Simulation Tests**:
   - Run extended simulations with realistic workflow patterns
   - Measure improvement in success rates and efficiency over time
   - Test with historical data to validate learning outcomes
   - Verify that learned policies generalize to new types of queries

Success criteria: 15%+ improvement in workflow success rates after training, <500ms model inference time, zero safety violations in production testing.
