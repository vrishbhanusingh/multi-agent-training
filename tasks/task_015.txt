# Task ID: 15
# Title: Production Deployment and Operational Infrastructure Setup
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Prepare the multi-agent system for production deployment by implementing containerization, infrastructure automation, monitoring, scaling strategies, and comprehensive operational documentation.
# Details:
This task involves several key components to ensure production readiness:

1. Containerization:
   - Dockerize all system components with optimized images
   - Create docker-compose files for local development
   - Implement multi-stage builds to minimize image sizes
   - Ensure proper environment variable configuration

2. Infrastructure as Code:
   - Develop Terraform or CloudFormation templates for all required infrastructure
   - Include network configuration, security groups, and access controls
   - Implement state management for infrastructure deployments
   - Create separate environments for development, staging, and production

3. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Set up automated build, test, and deployment pipelines
   - Implement branch-based deployment strategies
   - Configure automated testing in the pipeline
   - Set up deployment approval processes for production

4. Monitoring and Observability:
   - Implement centralized logging with ELK or similar stack
   - Set up metrics collection with Prometheus or equivalent
   - Create Grafana dashboards for system performance visualization
   - Implement distributed tracing with Jaeger or similar

5. Scaling Strategy:
   - Implement horizontal scaling for stateless components
   - Configure auto-scaling rules based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics
   - Ensure database scaling and connection pooling
   - Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms

6. Operational Documentation:
   - Create runbooks for common operational tasks
   - Document troubleshooting procedures
   - Develop incident response playbooks
   - Create system architecture diagrams

7. Security Measures:
   - Implement secrets management
   - Configure network security policies
   - Set up vulnerability scanning in the pipeline
   - Document security protocols and compliance measures

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify all aspects of the production deployment:

1. Infrastructure Validation:
   - Run terraform plan/apply in a test environment to verify infrastructure creation
   - Validate that all resources are created with proper configurations
   - Test infrastructure recovery from simulated failures

2. Deployment Pipeline Testing:
   - Verify that CI/CD pipeline successfully builds and deploys all components
   - Test rollback procedures by intentionally deploying a faulty version
   - Measure deployment times and optimize if necessary

3. Load and Performance Testing:
   - Conduct load tests simulating expected production traffic
   - Verify auto-scaling triggers and proper scaling behavior
   - Measure response times under various load conditions
   - Test system behavior at 2x and 5x expected load

4. Monitoring Validation:
   - Verify all metrics are being collected correctly
   - Test alerting by triggering test conditions
   - Validate that logs are properly aggregated and searchable
   - Ensure tracing provides adequate visibility into system operations

5. Disaster Recovery Testing:
   - Simulate component failures and verify system resilience
   - Test database failover mechanisms
   - Validate data backup and restoration procedures
   - Run chaos engineering experiments to identify weak points

6. Security Assessment:
   - Conduct penetration testing on the deployed infrastructure
   - Verify that secrets are properly managed and not exposed
   - Test authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Validate that all security controls are functioning as expected
