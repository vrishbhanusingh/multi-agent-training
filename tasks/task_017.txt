# Task ID: 17
# Title: Integrate Supabase Storage for Large File Handling in Multi-Agent System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a Supabase Storage integration that enables agents to efficiently exchange large files that exceed messaging system limits, with proper access controls and seamless client interactions.
# Details:
This implementation requires several key components:

1. **Supabase Configuration**:
   - Create dedicated storage buckets with appropriate naming conventions (e.g., 'agent-transfers', 'persistent-data')
   - Configure CORS policies to allow access from agent environments
   - Set up bucket-level and file-level access policies
   - Implement retention policies for temporary file transfers

2. **Access Control Implementation**:
   - Develop a permission system using Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
   - Create agent authentication mechanisms using Supabase JWT tokens
   - Implement role-based access for different agent types
   - Design a secure token refresh mechanism

3. **File Transfer Protocol**:
   - Create a standardized file reference format for RabbitMQ messages
   - Implement file chunking for very large files (>100MB)
   - Design metadata schema for file transfers including checksums, timestamps, and access permissions
   - Develop retry mechanisms for failed transfers

4. **Client Libraries**:
   - Create a unified client interface for all agent types
   - Implement methods for upload, download, list, and delete operations
   - Add streaming capabilities for real-time processing
   - Build progress tracking and reporting mechanisms
   - Implement proper error handling and logging

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement connection pooling for Supabase interactions
   - Add caching mechanisms for frequently accessed files
   - Create background workers for asynchronous file operations
   - Optimize for different file types (binary, text, media)

The implementation should be compatible with the existing agent communication system and follow the established security protocols from Task #11.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify functionality, performance, and security aspects:

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test each client library method with various file types and sizes
   - Verify proper error handling for network issues, permission errors, and invalid inputs
   - Test authentication and token refresh mechanisms
   - Validate file chunking and reassembly functions

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test end-to-end file transfers between different agent types
   - Verify RabbitMQ message passing with file references
   - Test concurrent access scenarios with multiple agents
   - Validate proper cleanup of temporary files

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Measure upload/download speeds for files of varying sizes (1MB, 10MB, 100MB, 1GB)
   - Test system under load with multiple concurrent transfers
   - Verify performance degradation patterns under stress
   - Benchmark against direct RabbitMQ transfers for comparison

4. **Security Tests**:
   - Verify that agents cannot access unauthorized files
   - Test for common vulnerabilities (injection attacks, path traversal)
   - Validate that file metadata doesn't expose sensitive information
   - Ensure secure handling of authentication tokens

5. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - Successful transfer of 1GB+ files between agents
   - Transfer speeds of at least 10MB/s under normal conditions
   - Zero data loss during transfers, even with connection interruptions
   - Proper access controls preventing unauthorized access
   - Seamless integration with existing agent communication patterns
