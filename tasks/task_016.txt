# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Disaster Recovery and High Availability Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement comprehensive disaster recovery and high availability mechanisms for the multi-agent system to ensure business continuity during infrastructure failures or service disruptions.
# Details:
This task involves creating a robust disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA) strategy for the production multi-agent system. The implementation should include:

1. **Data Backup and Recovery**:
   - Implement automated, regular backups of all critical data stores
   - Design and test data recovery procedures with defined RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
   - Implement point-in-time recovery capabilities where appropriate

2. **High Availability Architecture**:
   - Design redundant system components across multiple availability zones
   - Implement automatic failover mechanisms for critical services
   - Configure load balancing to distribute traffic and prevent single points of failure
   - Implement stateless service design where possible to facilitate recovery

3. **Disaster Recovery Planning**:
   - Create a multi-region DR strategy with active-passive or active-active configurations
   - Document step-by-step recovery procedures for different failure scenarios
   - Implement infrastructure-as-code templates for rapid environment recreation

4. **Resilience Testing**:
   - Develop chaos engineering practices to regularly test system resilience
   - Implement circuit breakers and retry mechanisms for service dependencies
   - Create graceful degradation strategies for partial system failures

5. **Monitoring and Alerting for DR/HA**:
   - Configure specialized monitoring for replication lag, backup status, and failover readiness
   - Implement alerting for potential DR/HA issues before they impact recovery capabilities

The implementation should be fully integrated with the existing CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure automation developed in Task 15. All DR/HA mechanisms should be thoroughly documented in operational runbooks.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this task should verify both the technical implementation and operational readiness of the DR/HA strategy:

1. **Backup and Recovery Testing**:
   - Verify automated backups are created according to the defined schedule
   - Conduct full recovery tests in isolated environments to validate RTO/RPO targets
   - Test point-in-time recovery for various scenarios and measure recovery times

2. **Failover Testing**:
   - Simulate infrastructure failures (compute, network, storage) to verify automatic failover
   - Measure failover times and verify they meet business requirements
   - Test manual failover procedures for scenarios requiring human intervention

3. **Multi-Region Recovery**:
   - Conduct a full DR drill by simulating primary region failure
   - Verify all services can be restored in the secondary region
   - Test data consistency and application functionality after recovery

4. **Resilience Verification**:
   - Run chaos engineering experiments in staging environments
   - Verify circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
   - Test graceful degradation by disabling non-critical services

5. **Documentation Validation**:
   - Conduct tabletop exercises with operations teams using the DR runbooks
   - Have team members unfamiliar with the system attempt to follow recovery procedures
   - Time recovery operations and refine procedures based on findings

All tests should be documented with results, including metrics for recovery time and any issues encountered. A final report should demonstrate that the system meets the defined availability targets and can recover from various failure scenarios within acceptable timeframes.
