# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Enhanced Database Schema for Reinforcement Learning Workflow Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 20
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement comprehensive database schema changes to support the Adaptive Orchestration Loop, including workflow tracking, task rewards, structured feedback storage, and experience data for reinforcement learning.
# Details:
Upgrade the existing database schema to support the full Adaptive Orchestration Loop with comprehensive tracking and learning capabilities:

1. **Workflows Table Enhancement**:
   - Create new 'workflows' table to track complete user request lifecycles
   - Include fields for: workflow_id (UUID), user_prompt (TEXT), creation_timestamp, final_status, total_reward
   - Add workflow metadata including complexity estimates and execution metrics
   - Implement workflow versioning for tracking DAG evolution over time

2. **Tasks Table Schema Upgrade**:
   - Extend existing tasks table with RL-specific columns:
     * reward (FLOAT) - quantitative performance score from EvaluatorAgent
     * feedback_notes (JSONB) - structured error details and validation results
     * retries (INT) - count of retry attempts for learning from persistence
     * correction_generation (INT) - tracks which correction cycle generated this task
     * parent_workflow_id (UUID) - links tasks to workflows for holistic tracking
   - Add indexes for performance optimization on reward queries and workflow lookups
   - Implement audit trail capabilities for tracking task modifications

3. **Experience Buffer Tables**:
   - Create 'experiences' table for storing RL training data:
     * experience_id, workflow_id, state_context (JSONB), action_taken (JSONB), reward_received, timestamp
   - Design 'correction_attempts' table to track DAG surgery operations:
     * attempt_id, failed_task_id, correction_plan (JSONB), success_outcome, execution_time
   - Add 'learning_episodes' table for tracking complete RL episodes

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Create appropriate indexes for common query patterns
   - Implement table partitioning for large-scale data management
   - Add database connection pooling configuration
   - Design data retention policies for managing storage growth

5. **Migration and Data Safety**:
   - Create reversible database migration scripts
   - Implement data backup procedures before schema changes
   - Add data validation rules to ensure referential integrity
   - Create rollback procedures for failed migrations

6. **Analytics and Reporting Views**:
   - Create database views for common analytics queries
   - Implement materialized views for performance-critical reports
   - Add stored procedures for complex reward calculations
   - Design data export capabilities for external analysis tools

The schema should be designed for scalability to handle thousands of workflows and millions of tasks while maintaining query performance.

# Test Strategy:
Comprehensive testing should validate schema correctness, performance, and data integrity:

1. **Schema Validation Tests**:
   - Verify all tables create successfully with proper constraints
   - Test foreign key relationships and referential integrity
   - Validate index creation and query optimization
   - Test data type constraints and validation rules

2. **Migration Testing**:
   - Test migration scripts on copies of production-like data
   - Verify data preservation during schema updates
   - Test rollback procedures for failed migrations
   - Validate migration performance on large datasets

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Benchmark query performance for common access patterns
   - Test with large datasets (10K+ workflows, 100K+ tasks)
   - Measure insert/update performance for high-throughput scenarios
   - Validate index effectiveness for reward and feedback queries

4. **Data Integrity Tests**:
   - Test referential integrity under concurrent access
   - Verify JSONB storage and retrieval for feedback_notes
   - Test transaction handling for multi-table updates
   - Validate data consistency after system failures

5. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test schema integration with existing agent code
   - Verify compatibility with ORM/database access patterns
   - Test with actual task execution and evaluation scenarios
   - Validate analytics views produce correct results

6. **Load and Stress Tests**:
   - Test database performance under high concurrent load
   - Verify graceful degradation under resource constraints
   - Test backup and recovery procedures with large datasets
   - Validate monitoring and alerting for database health

Success criteria: All migrations complete without data loss, query performance <100ms for 95th percentile, zero referential integrity violations.
