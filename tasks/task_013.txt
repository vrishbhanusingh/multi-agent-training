# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Query Understanding Layer with NLU Capabilities
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a natural language understanding system that processes user queries, extracts structured information, resolves ambiguities, and produces standardized problem specifications for the orchestration layer.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive Query Understanding Layer that serves as the entry point for all user interactions with the system. This layer should:

1. Parse raw natural language queries using NLP techniques
2. Extract key entities, intents, and parameters from user input
3. Implement context management to handle multi-turn conversations and reference resolution
4. Develop disambiguation mechanisms to clarify user intent when queries are ambiguous
5. Create a standardized problem specification format that can be consumed by the orchestration layer (Task #12)
6. Implement query normalization to handle variations in how users express similar intents
7. Build confidence scoring for extracted information to flag uncertain interpretations
8. Create a feedback mechanism that allows the orchestration layer to request clarification when needed
9. Implement domain-specific understanding capabilities aligned with the system's core functionalities
10. Design the layer with extensibility in mind to accommodate new domains and query types

Technical implementation should include:
- Integration with a modern NLU framework (e.g., Rasa, Dialogflow, or custom transformer-based solution)
- A modular architecture allowing for component upgrades
- Efficient error handling and logging for query processing failures
- Performance optimization to ensure low latency response times
- Clear API documentation for the standardized problem specification format

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify the Query Understanding Layer correctly interprets user intent and produces accurate problem specifications:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test individual NLU components (entity extraction, intent classification, etc.)
   - Verify normalization functions handle expected input variations
   - Test disambiguation logic with ambiguous inputs

2. Integration Tests:
   - Verify correct interaction with the orchestration layer (Task #12)
   - Test end-to-end query processing with sample inputs
   - Validate proper handling of context in multi-turn scenarios

3. Benchmark Tests:
   - Measure accuracy metrics (precision, recall, F1) on a diverse test set of queries
   - Evaluate performance under load (response time, throughput)

4. Specific Test Cases:
   - Simple queries with clear intent (e.g., "What's the weather today?")
   - Complex queries requiring multiple processing steps
   - Ambiguous queries needing disambiguation
   - Queries with references to previous context
   - Malformed or out-of-domain queries
   - Edge cases with unusual phrasing or specialized terminology

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Create a test harness allowing manual verification of query understanding
   - Develop a confusion matrix to track misclassifications and understanding errors

Success criteria: >90% accuracy on the test dataset, with <200ms average processing time per query.
