Develop adapter classes that convert between our internal message representations and A2A format.\n4.

Implement proper error handling for malformed messages.\n7. Ensure backward compatibility during transition period by supporting both old and new formats.\n8. Update configuration to enable/disable A2A protocol usage.\n9. Optimize message processing to minimize performance impact.\n10.
