# Task ID: 5
# Title: Integrate Agent State and Memory with Redis
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Allow agents to store and retrieve state/memory via the MCP server and Redis.
# Details:
Implement endpoints and agent logic for state/memory management using Redis.

# Test Strategy:
Store and retrieve agent state/memory via API and verify persistence in Redis.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Redis schema for agent state [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the data structure for storing agent state in Redis
### Details:
Create JSON schema with fields for agent ID, status, configuration, and runtime properties. Define Redis keys structure and TTL policies.

## 2. Design Redis schema for agent memory [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Define the data structure for storing agent memory/history in Redis
### Details:
Create schema for storing message history, conversation context, and agent-specific memory entries. Consider time-based indexing and memory retention policies.

## 3. Implement state endpoints in MCP server [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Add FastAPI endpoints for state management
### Details:
Add GET, PUT, DELETE endpoints for /agents/{agent_id}/state in server.py. Implement Redis operations in redis_client.py.

## 4. Implement memory endpoints in MCP server [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Add FastAPI endpoints for memory management
### Details:
Add GET, PUT, DELETE endpoints for /agents/{agent_id}/memory in server.py. Implement Redis operations for list management in redis_client.py.

## 5. Add state client functions in agents [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Implement state storage/retrieval in each agent
### Details:
Create redis_state.py in each agent with functions to store/retrieve state via MCP API. Add agent-specific state management logic.

## 6. Add memory client functions in agents [done]
### Dependencies: 5.4
### Description: Implement memory storage/retrieval in each agent
### Details:
Create redis_memory.py in each agent with functions to store/retrieve memory via MCP API. Add agent-specific memory management logic.

## 7. Add Gemini memory integration [done]
### Dependencies: 5.6
### Description: Ensure Gemini has context from agent memory
### Details:
Modify gemini_llm.py to incorporate relevant memory as context for the LLM. Add memory retrieval before prompt generation.

## 8. Write integration tests [done]
### Dependencies: 5.5, 5.6
### Description: Create tests for state and memory functionality
### Details:
Add tests that verify state persistence and memory retrieval through API calls and agent interactions.
