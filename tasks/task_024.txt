# Task ID: 24
# Title: Build Observability Dashboard for Adaptive Orchestration Loop Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20, 21, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a comprehensive monitoring and visualization dashboard that tracks the performance, learning progress, and operational health of the Adaptive Orchestration Loop system, providing insights into workflow success rates, correction effectiveness, and RL training progress.
# Details:
Create a sophisticated monitoring and analytics platform that provides visibility into all aspects of the learning orchestration system:

1. **Real-time System Health Dashboard**:
   - Implement live monitoring of all system components (orchestrator, evaluator, executors)
   - Create health indicators for message queue depths, database performance, and service availability
   - Add automated alerting for system anomalies and performance degradation
   - Include resource utilization tracking (CPU, memory, network I/O)

2. **Workflow Analytics and Performance Metrics**:
   - Design visualizations for workflow success rates over time
   - Create metrics for average workflow completion times and resource usage
   - Implement trend analysis for workflow complexity and user query patterns
   - Add comparative analysis between corrected and non-corrected workflows

3. **Learning Performance Visualization**:
   - Create dashboards for RL training progress and model performance metrics
   - Implement reward distribution visualizations and trend analysis
   - Add correction attempt success rate tracking over time
   - Include model accuracy and safety constraint monitoring

4. **Error Analysis and Diagnostic Tools**:
   - Implement error categorization and frequency analysis
   - Create root cause analysis tools for common failure patterns
   - Add drill-down capabilities for investigating specific workflow failures
   - Include correlation analysis between error types and system conditions

5. **Interactive Query and Investigation Tools**:
   - Build query interfaces for exploring historical workflow data
   - Implement workflow replay capabilities for debugging and analysis
   - Add custom dashboard creation tools for different stakeholder needs
   - Include data export capabilities for external analysis

6. **Predictive Analytics and Recommendations**:
   - Implement predictive models for identifying workflows at risk of failure
   - Create recommendation engines for system optimization
   - Add capacity planning tools based on usage trends
   - Include performance bottleneck identification and suggestions

The dashboard should be built using modern web technologies with real-time updates, responsive design, and role-based access control for different types of users (operators, developers, researchers).

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify dashboard functionality, accuracy, and performance under various conditions:

1. **Functional Tests**:
   - Test all dashboard components with known data sets
   - Verify chart accuracy and data refresh mechanisms
   - Test interactive features like drill-down and filtering
   - Validate alerting triggers and notification systems

2. **Data Accuracy Tests**:
   - Compare dashboard metrics with direct database queries
   - Test with historical data to verify trend calculations
   - Validate aggregation logic for complex metrics
   - Test with edge cases like missing or corrupted data

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Test dashboard responsiveness with large datasets
   - Measure page load times and data refresh performance
   - Test with concurrent users accessing the dashboard
   - Verify memory usage and browser performance

4. **Real-time Monitoring Tests**:
   - Test live data updates during active system operation
   - Verify alert triggering under various system conditions
   - Test dashboard behavior during system outages
   - Validate data consistency between real-time and historical views

5. **User Experience Tests**:
   - Conduct usability testing with different user roles
   - Test responsive design on various devices and screen sizes
   - Verify accessibility compliance and keyboard navigation
   - Test workflow replay and investigation tools

6. **Integration Tests**:
   - Test integration with all system components for data collection
   - Verify compatibility with existing monitoring infrastructure
   - Test data export and external tool integration
   - Validate role-based access control and security features

Success criteria: <2 second page load times, 99.9% data accuracy, zero false positive alerts, positive user feedback on usability.
