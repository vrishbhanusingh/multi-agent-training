# Gemini Integration Implementation Log

Date: April 29, 2025

## Summary

Today I implemented Google's Gemini large language model as the "thinking" component for all agents in the system. Each agent now uses Gemini to process received messages, think about appropriate responses, and generate messages to send to other agents.

## Implementation Details

1. **Gemini Client Setup**
   - Copied the existing `gemini_llm.py` from agent_a to both agent_b and agent_c
   - This module provides a unified interface for Gemini API calls with support for both API key and Vertex AI authentication

2. **Agent Code Updates**
   - Replaced transformers pipeline in agent_a with Gemini
   - Added Gemini integration to agent_b and agent_c (which previously had no LLM)
   - Implemented structured prompt templates for each agent to:
     - Process received messages
     - Separate "thinking" from responses
     - Generate contextually relevant replies

3. **Message Processing Workflow**
   - When an agent receives a message, it uses Gemini to analyze it
   - The LLM separates its response into THINKING and RESPONSE sections
   - The agent logs its "thinking" process for transparency
   - Only the actual response is sent back to the original sender

4. **Periodic Messaging**
   - All agents now send periodic messages to randomly selected other agents
   - Different intervals (30s, 45s, 60s) prevent synchronized message storms
   - Messages are generated using Gemini with agent-specific context

5. **Testing**
   - Added test_gemini_integration.py to verify proper parsing of Gemini responses
   - Tests include mock integration to avoid API calls during testing

## Environment Configuration

Updated docker-compose.yml to include Gemini environment variables for all agents:
- GEMINI_API_KEY: Required for API access
- GEMINI_MODEL: Specifies which Gemini model to use

Created a .env.template for users to easily configure their own API keys.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the quality of inter-agent conversations
2. Consider adding specialized prompts for each agent to give them distinct "personalities"
3. Implement more sophisticated conversation memory using Redis
4. Add conversation logging for analysis
