# Agent Integration Log

## Overview
This log documents the implementation of individual agent containers (agent_a, agent_b, agent_c), their Dockerfiles, basic agent scripts, and the integration of these agents into the system's Docker Compose setup.

---

## 1. Agent Directory Structure
- Created an `agents/` directory with subdirectories for each agent:
  - `agents/agent_a/`
  - `agents/agent_b/`
  - `agents/agent_c/`

---

## 2. Dockerfiles for Each Agent
- Each agent has its own `Dockerfile` (in its respective folder) based on `python:3.10-slim`.
- Each Dockerfile:
  - Sets the working directory to `/app`.
  - Copies the agent's code into the container.
  - Installs `pika` and `redis` Python packages for RabbitMQ and Redis integration.
  - Sets the default command to run `agent.py`.

---

## 3. Basic Agent Scripts
- Each agent has a minimal `agent.py` script that:
  - Connects to RabbitMQ using environment variables for host, port, user, and password.
  - Declares and binds to its own queue (named after the agent).
  - Listens for messages on its queue and prints any received messages.
  - Retries connection if RabbitMQ is not available.
- This provides a working message consumer for each agent, ready for further logic.

---

## 4. Docker Compose Integration
- Updated `docker-compose.yml` to add three new services: `agent_a`, `agent_b`, and `agent_c`.
- Each agent service:
  - Builds from its own context and Dockerfile.
  - Depends on `rabbitmq` and `redis` services.
  - Receives environment variables for RabbitMQ and Redis connection.
- All services share the same Docker network for inter-service communication.

---

## 5. Next Steps & Recommendations
- **Agent Logic:** Implement more advanced logic in each agent (e.g., responding to messages, updating state in Redis, sending messages to other agents).
- **Agent Registration:** Optionally, have each agent register itself with the MCP server on startup.
- **Monitoring:** Add logging or monitoring to track agent activity and health.
- **Testing:** Test message sending to each agent via the MCP or directly through RabbitMQ.
- **Customization:** Customize each agent's Dockerfile or dependencies as needed for specialized behavior.

---

## 6. Summary
The system now supports running multiple agents as independent containers, each capable of receiving messages via RabbitMQ. This foundation enables further development of agent behaviors, inter-agent communication, and integration with the MCP server and Redis for stateful, distributed multi-agent workflows. 

---

## 7. Automated Testing Setup (2024-04-27)

### Overview
A robust automated testing framework has been added for all agents (`agent_a`, `agent_b`, `agent_c`) using `pytest` inside the Docker Compose environment. This ensures that each agent's ability to connect to RabbitMQ, declare queues, and send/receive messages is continuously verified.

### What Was Done
- **Testing Framework:** Chose `pytest` for all Python-based agent tests.
- **Requirements:** Added `pytest` to each agent's `requirements.txt`.
- **Dockerfiles:** Updated all agent Dockerfiles to install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- **Test Directories:** Created a `tests/` directory in each agent folder.
- **Smoke Tests:** Added a basic smoke test (`test_smoke.py`) to each agent to verify the test setup.
- **RabbitMQ Integration Tests:**
  - Each agent now has a `test_rabbitmq.py` with tests for:
    - Connecting to RabbitMQ using environment variables
    - Declaring and binding its queue to the correct exchange
    - Publishing and consuming a test message (using a test-specific queue to avoid interference)
- **Shell Script for All Tests:**
  - Created `run_all_agent_tests.sh` at the project root.
  - This script runs all tests for all agents in sequence using Docker Compose.
  - Usage: `./run_all_agent_tests.sh`

### How to Run All Agent Tests
1. **Ensure all containers are up:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
2. **Run all agent tests:**
   ```bash
   ./run_all_agent_tests.sh
   ```
   This will execute all `pytest` tests for `agent_a`, `agent_b`, and `agent_c` and print the results.

### What These Tests Cover
- **Connection to RabbitMQ** with correct credentials and environment variables
- **Queue declaration and binding** to the `agent_communication` exchange
- **Message publishing and consumption** (verifies end-to-end message flow for each agent)
- **Basic Python environment sanity** (smoke test)

### Next Steps (Recommended)
- **Expand Test Coverage:**
  - Add tests for Redis integration and MCP API endpoints.
  - Write cross-agent communication tests (e.g., send from one agent, receive in another).
  - Add error handling and negative tests (e.g., what happens if RabbitMQ is down).
- **Continuous Integration:**
  - Integrate the test script into your CI/CD pipeline for automated checks on every commit.
- **Testing Agent:**
  - Use the `testing_agent` container for more advanced end-to-end and system tests.
- **Agent Logic:**
  - Add tests for custom agent logic as it evolves.
- **Documentation:**
  - Keep this log updated with new tests and testing strategies.

### Summary
The project now has a clear, repeatable, and automated way to verify that all agents are correctly integrated with RabbitMQ and that the Docker Compose environment is working as intended. This foundation makes it easy to add more advanced tests and ensures confidence in future changes.
