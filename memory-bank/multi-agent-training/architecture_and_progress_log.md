# Project Log: Multi-Agent System

## Overview
This project is a multi-agent system designed for scalable, distributed agent communication and state management. The system uses:
- **FastAPI** for the MCP (Master Control Program) server
- **Redis** for fast, in-memory agent state and memory storage
- **RabbitMQ** for robust, scalable agent-to-agent messaging
- **Docker Compose** for orchestration of all services

---

## 1. Initial Setup
- Created a new repository and initialized the following structure:
  - `mcp/` for server and core logic
  - `docker/` for Docker-related files
  - `docker-compose.yml` for service orchestration
  - `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies

---

## 2. Docker Compose Infrastructure
- **docker-compose.yml** provisions three main services:
  - **RabbitMQ** (with management UI)
  - **Redis** (with persistence)
  - **MCP Server** (FastAPI app)
- Exposes ports for each service and sets up health checks and environment variables.

---

## 3. MCP Server (`mcp/server.py`)
- Built with FastAPI, exposes HTTP endpoints for:
  - Health check (`/health`)
  - Agent state management (`/agent/{agent_id}/state` GET/POST)
  - Agent memory management (`/agent/{agent_id}/memory` GET/POST)
  - Agent registration (`/agent/{agent_id}/register`)
  - Sending messages to agents (`/agent/{agent_id}/send`)
  - Broadcasting messages to all agents (`/broadcast`)
- Integrates with Redis and RabbitMQ via custom client classes.
- Uses CORS middleware for cross-origin access.
- Handles startup/shutdown events to manage RabbitMQ connections.

---

## 4. Redis Integration (`mcp/redis_client.py`)
- Provides a `RedisClient` class for:
  - Storing and retrieving agent state as JSON
  - Storing and retrieving agent memory as Redis hashes
- All methods are async for compatibility with FastAPI.
- Handles connection to Redis using Docker Compose service name.

---

## 5. RabbitMQ Integration (`mcp/rabbitmq_client.py`)
- Provides a `RabbitMQClient` class for:
  - Connecting to RabbitMQ using Docker Compose service name
  - Declaring a topic exchange (`agent_communication`)
  - Creating agent-specific queues and binding them to the exchange
  - Sending messages to specific agents or broadcasting
  - (Optionally) Consuming messages from queues (for agent implementation)
- All message publishing and queue creation is async for compatibility.

---

## 6. Demonstrated Endpoints and Features
- **Agent State**: Store and retrieve agent state via Redis
- **Agent Memory**: Store and retrieve agent memory via Redis
- **Agent Registration**: Create a dedicated RabbitMQ queue for each agent
- **Send Message**: Send a message to a specific agent via RabbitMQ
- **Broadcast**: Send a message to all agents via RabbitMQ

---

## 7. Testing and Validation
- Used `curl` to test all endpoints:
  - Verified state and memory storage/retrieval
  - Verified agent registration and message sending
  - Verified broadcast functionality
- Checked Docker Compose logs and container health

---

## 8. Next Steps (Suggestions)
- Implement agent consumers to process messages from RabbitMQ
- Add authentication and authorization for endpoints
- Add more advanced message routing and error handling
- Implement agent lifecycle management and monitoring

---

## 9. Summary
This log documents the step-by-step setup and integration of a scalable, distributed multi-agent system using FastAPI, Redis, and RabbitMQ, all orchestrated with Docker Compose. The system is now ready for further extension with real agents and more advanced features.
