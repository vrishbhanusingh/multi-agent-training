# Testing Agent and Communication Log

## Overview
This log documents the creation of a dedicated testing agent container, the process of sending test messages to all agents, and the successful verification of agent-to-agent communication in the multi-agent system.

---

## 1. Creation of the Testing Agent
- Added a new folder: `agents/testing_agent/`.
- Created a `Dockerfile` for the testing agent, similar to other agents, but set to launch an interactive shell (`/bin/bash`) by default.
- Added the testing agent as a service in `docker-compose.yml` with the same environment variables as other agents, so it can connect to RabbitMQ and Redis.
- Built and started the testing agent container.

---

## 2. Test Script for Communication
- Added a Python script `test_send.py` in `agents/testing_agent/`.
- The script connects to RabbitMQ and sends a test message to each agent (`agent_a`, `agent_b`, `agent_c`) using the `agent_communication` exchange.
- Example message: `Hello agent_a! This is a test message from the testing agent.`

---

## 3. Running the Test
- Entered the testing agent container with:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec testing_agent bash
  ```
- Ran the test script:
  ```bash
  python test_send.py
  ```
- Output confirmed that messages were sent to all agents.

---

## 4. Verifying Communication
- Checked the logs for each agent using:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs agent_a
  docker compose logs agent_b
  docker compose logs agent_c
  ```
- Each agent log showed receipt of the test message, e.g.:
  ```
  [agent_a] Received: Hello agent_a! This is a test message from the testing agent.
  ```
- RabbitMQ logs also confirmed successful message delivery.

---

## 5. Summary & Next Steps
- The testing agent provides a convenient way to run custom test scripts and verify system communication.
- The core agent-to-agent messaging flow is working as intended.
- You can now add more test scripts or expand agent logic for more advanced scenarios.

---

## 6. Quick Reference: How to Test Communication
1. Place your test script in `agents/testing_agent/`.
2. Rebuild and restart the testing agent container:
   ```bash
   docker compose build testing_agent
   docker compose up -d testing_agent
   ```
3. Enter the container and run your script:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec testing_agent bash
   python your_script.py
   ```
4. Check agent logs to verify message receipt.

This log serves as a simple guide for using the testing agent to verify and debug communication in your multi-agent system.
